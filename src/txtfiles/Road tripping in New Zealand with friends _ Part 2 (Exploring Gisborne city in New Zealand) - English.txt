we couldn't get this view but it's

amazing

so we're basically living in the middle

of nowhere

so we are here in outskirts of gisborne

city it's like a half an hour drive

from the city here it's pretty cool

that's the house

look at the sheeps there

okay

expect

exactly i wish we could have this every

day yeah

okay so i'm already

just tying up my shoes now we are

heading to get some breakfast in the

city in gisborne city

and then we'll go ahead with our plan

it's such a beautiful afternoon it's

already one o'clock

[Music]

okay we are going on a train ride so

it's a vintage

steam train that that was built

in 1897.

okay so you can see the train over there

[Music]

shortly so sure oh that's awesome

[Music]

thank you they're just running there i

mean yeah

just having some little breakfast this

train is so vintage

and it was built in 1897 the engine of

this train

so it's like very old and the fun fact

is

we are going um we are going to cross

the airport runway as well apparently

this is the only train

that fully crosses the runaway of

airport in the world

so it's going to be fun should we go out

and see

very good thank you this is desmond

vintage

gizman city vintage railway yeah and my

my job today is i'm a safety officer

and i'd make sure that all the

passengers are safe on the train

so this engine was built about 1901

and it was built in gisborne which the

train worked a lot of the time

in the distant areas

eventually in about the 1950s it became

uneconomic

so the service was closed and the

railway line was taken up

and the only thing remaining is some

bridges some tunnels

and there's a walkway

that's the old engine

[Music]

[Music]

so i'm one of the firemen for the city

of railway

oh okay so i maintain the boiler

uh-huh make sure there's enough water

and make enough fire so we can

generate enough sink right yeah oh

that's pretty cool

and what was that you were doing well

this is cold

so that's just that's cold and that goes

straight into the firebox

oh in here and that's how the engine

runs

like old times yeah this is an old-timey

thing this is

1897 1997 this was such a unique

experience

if you ever visit gizmo city you should

definitely do this

[Music]

so we are in botanical gardens

it's here dark now isn't it yeah it's

getting dark

yeah it's not even 5 p.m

but so yeah here we are

and it looks quite nice yeah by the way

the birds chirping around in the

background

yeah that's really very coming yeah yeah

so this is the

entrance yeah farm desert gardens

okay

it's becoming so quiet

it's very peaceful and calm around here

[Music]

[Music]

first

[Music]

this is onira beach and this place

was named on raw by the ancestor

hineha karingi this beach and the birds

and kites

that swept the skies above had great

significance to the first

people of this region wow

interesting

so over here this is a historic statue

and it has got a very interesting story

it says land the statue depicting the

historic cycle of new zealand by young

so the story behind this statue is when

captain cook

and his crew in 1769

they were selling and when they first

sighted the land

so there was this boy called young nick

he saw the land first here in the east

coast of north island

and he was just waving at the people

over here saying

we found land and that's how you know

this touch is

made

so this is the city center of gisborne

city and it is so pretty

let me show you

the town is very quiet at the moment

anishi and i we're just walking we're

just trying to explore the town

and find some souvenir shops so that we

can take some memories along to auckland

yes i know i can't even figure out where

the gps is taking you just walking on

the road

so this area of the town

is full of historic buildings so these

all are historic buildings you can see

this is how the streets used to look

back in 1905
