hey guys welcome back to my channel so

many of you asked me regarding the

information about cost of living and

expenses in New Zealand as a student so

I thought of making this video to

explain this in detail when you are

studying abroad it's very important for

you to understand your cost expenses of

living and how to manage your finances

well so let's start off with the very

important expense rent so I've been

living in Auckland for the past two

years and rent here is really expensive

but it really depends on you know which

part of the city you are living in for

example if you are living in the city

area main city area so the rent is going

to be expensive than compared to the

suburbs so if you want to get your own

room in the city the rain rain can be

between 200 to 250 dollars or it could

go up to $300 if it's a really good

place and the location and if you are

sharing a room with someone else the

rain becomes cheaper so when I was

studying I lived in the main city area

and it was a 2 BHK flat and I shared it

with other 3 flatmates so I paid around

140 dollars each week and yes you have

to pay the rent here on weekly basis so

that's the thing if you are sharing the

flat with more people the rain becomes

cheaper and if you go to the suburb

areas like which are a bit far from the

city area the rent is going to be much

cheaper when you are looking for an

apartment I would suggest to go for the

ones which are already furnished which

already has fresh washing machine beds

and sofas because if you are gonna buy

this furniture it's gonna cost you a lot

bills like electricity hot water and

Wi-Fi it can be included within your

rent or if not you have to pay it

separately and the cost for electricity

and Wi-Fi each it can be around 15 to 20

dollars per month

another important expense is food and I

would suggest you guys if you really

want to save money on food it's better

to cook at home because if you're going

to eat outside all the time it's going

to be very expensive and if you want to

cook Indian food at home you can always

go to the Indian grocery stores over

here and they have you know all kinds of

Indian food

ingredients and I would suggest you guys

that before you come to New Zealand try

to learn at least few basic food dishes

that are easy to make so you know once

you get here it's not very difficult for

you to cook food and here's the cost of

groceries can be around twenty to thirty

dollars per week but it can be more or

less depending on how much grocery you

buy per week okay so now let's talk

about travel expense if you want to

travel around in Oakland by bus or train

the ticket prices start from two dollars

and the City Link buses cost you only

fifty cents and the best part is they

offer a great discount for students so

if you're a student you will get 20 to

25% discount on each side isn't that

great and the public transport in

Oakland is pretty convenient the buses

and train are always on time and they

always you know update you with their

schedule or timetable so it's pretty

cool so you have to use this hop card to

travel by bus and train so it looks like

this it says Oakland transport so

basically you have to tag this card on

that machine when you enter the bus and

just you know tag it off my leaving you

have to top of this card with some money

and then you can use it and if you want

to you can get your own vehicle as well

it's pretty convenient you travel around

by car but then you need to consider the

expenses that comes with it such as cost

of the car gas money parking fees

maintenance and servicing fees as I said

in my previous video as well as a

student in New Zealand it's very

important for you to have a part-time

job because it really helps you with

your expenses students are allowed to

work only 20 hours per week by law here

so you cannot work more than that but

during your college holidays you can

work full-time so it's the best time for

you to you know do some savings the

fixed minimum wage per hour is 17 point

70 dollars as of now but of course it

could be more than that depending on the

type of job and company so for example

you are working twenty hours and your

hourly wage is 17 point 70 dollars so it

would be 20 into 17 point 70 is three

fifty four dollars and you have to minus

the taxes as well so it should be around

like three hundred dollars and this

amount is you know good enough to manage

your expenses so these are some of the

main expenses that you know you need to

take care of and yeah if you are

studying in New Zealand or you know plan

to do so I wish you all the best and if

you have any other questions regarding

this please feel free to ask me or you

this video helps you and yeah thank you
