good morning everyone and welcome back

to my channel this is Neha I hope you

all are doing fine so I think this is

the second time I'm shooting a vlog in

my new apartment and thank you so much

for such a good response on my new house

tour I'm so glad you all liked it and

I'm super excited for today's Vlog

because I'm going to take you to my

workplace and show you what's a work day

in my life is like so yeah let's start

off with making some breakfast and chai

as you all already know by now that I

cannot start off my day without chai

without a good strong chai so let's make

one

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

so we're gonna make some avocado toast

because my go-to breakfast for a weekday

is usually chai and some avocado toast

and sometimes I add a banana to it so

it's kind of like a perfect and healthy

breakfast to start off the day with

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

cheers

I still have half an hour

um to finish my breakfast and get ready

um

it feels like a morning now so I catch a

train every day to work so I'm gonna

take you with me it's gonna be fun I'm

so excited for this video actually

because I've never done a video like

this like a work day in my life before

it's such a nice and sunny day

this is my favorite thing in the morning

to get out here and soak up in the Sun

let's get some vitamin D okay you might

already have seen this view in my house

to Vlog but it could get loud at times

because of this giant construction it's

actually blocking half of my view which

I'm very sad about but I've still got

this amazing view

is sunny it's kind of chilly at the

moment

but I'm glad we are heading towards

Summer very soon

how beautiful is this

oh look we've got a ship coming in

also I've got an update on the plant

she's growing her first flower

how cute is that

okay I am almost ready

so this is the work outfit for the day

so it's basically

um high-waist jeans that I'm wearing and

simple casual top and to add a little

bit of professional look to it I'm

wearing this Blazer so it's very comfy

so yeah this is how I usually dress up

for work so I try to mix little bit of

both professional and Casual look okay

let's get going now we have to catch the

train

it's so good that it's not raining today

otherwise I would have to carry an

umbrella let's go

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

just in time so I got the train from

britomart station which is like a main

Hub or Junction of drains in Auckland as

you can see there is hardly anyone in

the train it's a good thing for me

because lots of the people they travel

to the city in the morning and I'm going

the opposite way so it's a good thing

for me I can avoid the morning rush so

it's quite a pleasant journey for me

every morning we are here

so this is Sylvia Park

um train station I'm going to book the

cab now

so it's kind of like five to ten minutes

um to reach work from here

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

foreign

so yeah this is me this is my desk this

is where I um work every day and yeah I

quite love it here and I love how my

desk is positioned right next to the

window so I have like lots of light here

so here is a little bit about my role so

supply chain and Logistics of a business

here in Auckland and yeah I've been
