a month ago and yeah it's very cute

apartment it's kind of small but very

cute so this is a high-rise apartment

which is like we are quite high up in

the air one of the reasons to move into

this apartment was the view it has got

the stunning view okay i'm going to show

it to you later so let's begin with the

kitchen area so this is our cute little

kitchen so the kitchen has got a lot of

storage as you can see this is just me

and my flatmate stuff

and

it also has all the basic things like

you know the glasses the all the cutlery

utensils a mixer a juicer and whatnot

so that's pretty convenient

so this is the fridge here

and the freezer i like how well designed

this place is i mean they fit the fridge

perfectly here

so

these are the little cute drawers

the kitchen is very well equipped

yeah okay let's go to the lounge

this is the dining table

and the sofa we have a l-shaped couch

which is like so comfy oh my god i can

literally like sit here and lay down for

hours

and also we have over here as you can

see this is like a centralized heating

system here which keeps us very warm

during the winter nights okay let's move

on to the best part now the view

oh look how windy this is but the view

oh my god look at the view

as you can see we are really high up in

the air okay i'll show you this

as you can see

[Music]

i really hope you don't have acrophobia

but i think i'm really getting used to

this height now

oh by the way we need

our plant

we've got this plant and it's a peace

lily plant and we have named her grace

so meet grace everyone

so as you can see

this is the port of auckland

all those ships and boats

yeah and if you go to this side

it's all city view

and there is rangitoto island it's a

very famous island

in auckland

you can see devonport as well

so basically this is

the heart of auckland

that we are living in

[Music]

and the balcony is very long

okay come on

you can

see this is like a perfect place to you

know stand out here have your chai or

coffee or whatever and you know just

look at the beautiful view

so basically we have a 90 degree view of

auckland so this is one view and the

other view is on that side which we can

see it from our rooms so i'll show that

to you in a bit yeah okay so this is

basically

the balcony to my room okay

let's

go see the rooms

so these doors are pretty amazing once

you shut it you can't hear the wind

anymore see

it's very quiet now

okay let's go

okay so this is like a mini closet for

our washing machine it's a washing

machine plus dryer so it saves the space

and this is the range of things that we

need for

to do the laundry okay let's go to my

room now

let's go

okay so this is my room

and we just got plenty of natural light

and i always prefer the rooms which has

you know lots of natural light or

sunlight okay so the best part about

this room is it has got two views like

two balconies so this was the balcony i

showed you earlier

so

yeah it's connected to my bedroom

how amazing this is

so that's the balcony and the other view

is the city view which is here

so i've got a mini balcony here as well

as you can see so this is the city view

yeah

sometimes just i just stand here

especially at night you can see the moon

and everything very clearly

love this place malik seriously so you

can see city and the harbor as well

from here

so this is east

and i every day i wake up to the sunrise

that's the best part

i can never get over this view

oh by the way this is a lovely photo

frame gifted by one of my lovely friends

so i thought this would be the perfect

spot to hang it

okay

and this is my closet

which is quite spacious so i've put all

my clothes here and

that's the other side

so it fits everything so yeah that's my

sweet and lovely room this is the best

place i've ever lived in trust me i mean

laying here and

looking at the view

like you're living in the middle of the

city nice the views and

you know it's like we are so close to

everything yeah it doesn't feel like we

live right here like this a train

station yeah a bus stop but

up here it's just quiet i would say we

were just lucky to have found this place

we didn't have to search a lot i'd say

yeah we yeah this was like the second or

third house that we saw and like you

know we walked in and we just asked that

lady we're like oh my god can we take it

yeah and she was like yeah well you need

to put in an application and stuff yeah

and i was like are we gonna get it yeah

we're praying that we get it and then

finally we got the email saying you got

the house and we're like yes

yes so nice yeah the only problem we had

was we had too much stuff oh my god then

on the moving day

we literally were moving stuff from

morning to night tonight yeah we were

exhausted it was just from literally

from 8 00 a.m to 9 00 p.m yeah

going from one place to another yeah

thing to convert coffee lovers to child

lovers which i'm very successful

and we have this thing that some nights

we watch movies um

and we finally have a smart tv so we do

not have to use our laptops we can watch
