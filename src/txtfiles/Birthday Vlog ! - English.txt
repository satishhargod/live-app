and I slept quite late like 5 a.m in the

morning

um so yeah I woke up um a bit late today

and woke up to a nice and sunny day so

lots of people have been asking me

what's my resolution for uh my birthday

but I'm just not doing resolutions

anymore because I know I I suck at

keeping them I used to make lots of

resolution when I was you know younger

for me um instead of making resolutions

it's more like going with the flow for

me because I never really planned things

and I just go with it as it comes to me

you know so let's go out and see what

can we do for my birthday oh my God and

I also need to clean my place

so that's that could be a resolution for

today by the way I'll show you

what's the day looking like today

it's such a nice day

[Music]

sun's out

and here is a quick outfit check

let's get to go and

okay I'm out in the city look at the

sunshine so nice

we have a few different colors of roses

uh-huh can I have a look yeah yeah we've

got these ones here um

um each of the color yeah like mixed

together yeah all right

oh they're adjacent that's just for

myself because it's my birthday today so

I was like let's just treat myself with

something nice thank you that's a pretty

color like light yellowish yeah as they

open they go a really beautiful like

peachy kind of color wow beautiful I

love it yes or something like that that

looks so pretty cool

yeah awesome that's such a beautiful

Packaging

thank you so much worries so I just got

myself a bunch of these pretty flowers

as my birthday gift

and look at them how pretty they are

smell Divine I feel like getting flowers

is the best therapy because look at them

they are so pretty it's kind of a

self-care and you know whenever you're

feeling feeling down or even if you are

feeling happy just go out there and buy

yourself some flowers it's such a nice

feeling and everyone deserves flowers

and of course don't wait for someone to

give you flowers

just go pamper yourself with some nice

bouquet of flowers I think that's what

I'm gonna be doing from now on gifting

myself

um with some flowers every now and then
