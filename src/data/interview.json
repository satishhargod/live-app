      "type": "javascript",
      "answer": "<div > A callback function is a when passed a function as an argument to another function with an intention to be called at a later time. that is callback. This is commonly seen in asynchronous APIs; the API call returns immediately because it is asynchronous, so you pass a function into it that the API can call when it's done performing its asynchronous task.</br>  The simplest example I can think of in JavaScript is the setTimeout() function. It's a global function that accepts two arguments. The first argument is the callback function and the second argument is a delay in milliseconds. The function is designed to wait the appropriate amount of time, then invoke your callback function.</br>  But when working with a lot of dependent asynchronous operations with callback, you quickly end up in callback hell.</div>"

      "type": "node",
      "answer": "<div class=''> Node.js is a single-threaded machine that uses javascript as its scripting language. Due to a single thread in node.js, it handles memory more efficiently because there are no multiple threads due to which no thread management is needed. Now to handle workload efficiently and to take advantage of computer multi-core systems, cluster modules are created that provide us the way to make child processes that run simultaneously with a single parent process. Each child process (more specifically worker process) has its own event loop, memory, V8 instance, and shares the same server port.  <ul> <li><strong>fork()</strong>: This creates a new child process from master.</li> <li><strong>isMaster</strong>: This returns true if current process is master or else false.</li> <li><strong>isWorker</strong>: This returns true if current process is worker or else false.</li> <li><strong>process</strong> : This returns the child process which is global.</li> <li><strong>send()</strong>: This sends a message from worker to master or vice versa.</li> <li><strong>kill()</strong>: This is use to kill the current worker.</li> <li><strong>isDead</strong>: This returns true if current worker is dead or else false.</li> <li><strong>id</strong>: This is a unique id for worker.</li> <li><strong>settings</strong>: This returns an object containing cluster settings.</li> <li><strong>worker</strong>: This returns the current worker process.</li> <li><strong>workers</strong>: This returns all the workers of a process.</li> <li><strong>isConnected</strong>: This returns true if a current worker is connected to its master or else false.</li> <li><strong>disconnect()</strong>: This is to disconnect all workers.</li> </ul></div>"

Node js is single thread.  node js executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. <p>Node.js basically works on two concept</p><ul><li>Asynchronous</li><li>Non-blocking I/O</li></ul><p><strong>Non-blocking I/o: </strong>Non-blocking i/o &nbsp;means working with multiple requests without blocking the thread for a single request. I/O basically interacts with external systems such as files, databases. Node.js is not used for CPU-intensive work means for calculations, video processing because a single thread cannot handle the CPU works.</p> <p><strong>Asynchronous: </strong>Asynchronous is executing a callback function. The moment we get the response from the other server or database it will execute a callback function. Callback functions are called as soon as some work is finished and this is because the node.js uses an event-driven architecture. The single thread doesn’t work with the request instead it sends the request to another system which resolves the request and it is accessible for another request.</p> <p>To implement the concept of the system to handle the request &nbsp;node.js uses the concept of Libuv.</p><p>Libuv is an open-source library built-in C. It has a strong focus on asynchronous and &nbsp;I/O, this gives node access to the underlying computer operating system, file system, and networking.</p><p>Libuv implements two extremely important features of node.js &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Event loop</li><li>Thread pool</li></ul> <p><strong>Event loop: </strong>The event loop contains a single thread and is responsible for handling easy tasks like executing callbacks and network I/O. When the program is to initialize all the top-level code is executed, the code is not in the callback function. All the applications code that is inside callback functions will run in the event loop. EventLoop is the heart of node.js. When we start our node application the event loop starts running right away. Most of the work is done in the event loop.</p> <p>Nodejs use event-driven-architecture.</p> <ul><li>Events are emitted.</li><li>Event loop picks them up.</li><li>Callbacks are called.</li></ul> <p><strong>Event queue: </strong>As soon as the request is sent the thread places the request into a queue. It is known as an event queue. The process like app receiving HTTP request or server or a timer will emit event as soon as they are done with the work and event loop will pick up these events and call the callback functions that are associated with each event and response is sent to the client.&nbsp;</p> <p>The event loop is an indefinite loop that continuously receives the request and processes them. It checks the queue and waits for the incoming request indefinitely.</p> <p><strong>Thread pool: </strong>Though node.js is single-threaded it internally maintains a thread pool. When non-blocking requests are accepted there are processed in an event loop, but while accepting blocking requests it checks for available threads in a thread pool, assigns a thread to the client’s request which is then processed and send back to the event loop, and response is sent to the respective client.</p></div>"
